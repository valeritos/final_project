# final_project
This app is designed as a personal classroom assistant and consists of three different features:
- emotion recognition 12-layer CNN (across 7 emotions), coded to work as real-time camera feed
- real-time transcription feed
- translation of transcripted feed into a selected language
  <br>
All three features are in the streamlit app across two pages.
Necessary libraries can be downloaded using the requirements.txt file.
Please note that transcription and translation are done through APIs (Assembly and DeepL), so please obtain keys before trying to run the webapp.
